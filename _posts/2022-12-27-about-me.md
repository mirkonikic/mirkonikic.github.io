Hi!

### whoami
On the internet, i go by the name <a href="https://twitter.com/mirkhoff2" style="color:white">'mirkhoff'</a>.

I am a comp sci undergrad, hobbyist researcher, and in free time teaching assistant. I spend most of my time reading books and breaking most of the stuff i touch..

### mirkh.off blog
I wish to use this blog as a place to merge pieces of my knowledge in a whole, and one day release it as a hopefully advanced book for science enthusiasts! 
I interest my self in theoretic computer science, which i try to bend to my liking and create some weird and crazy projects, i interest my self heavily in maths, literature and electromagnetic field of physics to which im a newbie.

Most of the articles will be one of the three main categories: Research i or someone else did, Theory concept i grasped deeply or Project im building!
In whats left of my time, i usually play guitar, piano, football or workout.

I hope that you will like this blog!
