Hi!

### whoami
On the internet, i go by the name <a href="https://twitter.com/mirkhoff2" style="font-weight:bold; border-radius:12px; border-bottom:2px solid white; padding:5px">'mirkhoff'</a>.

I am a comp sci undergrad, hobbyist researcher, and in free time teaching assistant, who spends most of my time reading books, and breaking things.

### mirkh.off blog
I will use this blog as a place to share my adventures in theoretic computer science, which i try to bend to my liking and create some weird projects, maths, literature and electromagnetic field of physics to which im a newbie.

Most of the articles will belong to one of the four main categories: Research, Theory concept i grasped deeply, Book review or Project im building.
In whats left of my time, i usually play guitar, piano or football


I hope that you will like this blog!
