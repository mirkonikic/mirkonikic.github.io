Hi!

On the internet, i go by the name <a href="https://twitter.com/mirkhoff2" style="font-weight:bold; border-radius:12px; border-bottom:2px solid white; padding:5px">'mirkhoff'</a>.

I am a comp sci undergrad, hobbyist researcher, and in free time teaching assistant. I spend most of my time reading books, playing ctf's with my team and breaking most of the stuff i touch..

I wish to use this blog as a place to assemble pieces of my knowledge as a whole, and one day release it as a hopefully advanced book for science enthusiasts.
I interest my self in theoretic computer science, which i try to bend to my liking and create some weird and crazy projects, i also interest my self heavily in maths, literature and electromagnetic field of physics to which im a newbie.

Most of the articles will belong to one of the four main categories: Research, Theory concept i grasped deeply, Book review or Project im building!
In whats left of my time, i usually play guitar, piano, football or workout.

I hope that you will like this blog!
