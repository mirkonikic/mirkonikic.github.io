    "body": "Hi! whoami On the internet, i go by the name ‘mirkhoff’. I am a comp sci undergrad, hobbyist researcher, and in free time teaching assistant. I spend most of my time reading books and breaking most of the stuff i touch.. mirkh.off blog I wish to use this blog as a place to merge pieces of my knowledge in a whole, and one day release it as a hopefully advanced book for science enthusiasts! I interest my self in theoretic computer science, which i try to bend to my liking and create some weird and crazy projects, i also interest my self heavily in maths, literature and electromagnetic field of physics to which im a newbie. Most of the articles will be one of the three main categories: Research i or someone else did, Theory concept i grasped deeply, Book review or Project im building! In whats left of my time, i usually play guitar, piano, football or workout. I hope that you will like this blog!"
